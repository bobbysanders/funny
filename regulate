song="It was a clear black night\, a clear white moon\. \
Warren G is on the streets\, trying to consume\. \
Some skirts for the eve\, so I can get some funk\. \
Just rollin in my ride\, chillin all alone\. \
Just hit the eatside of the L B C\. \
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G\. \
Seen a car full of skirts aint no need to tweak\. \
All you skirts know what's up with 2 1 3\. \
So I hooks a left on the 2 1 to Lewis\. \
Some brothas shootin dice so I said lets do this\. \
I jumped out the ride\, and said whats up\? \
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said Im stuck\. \
Since these girls peepin me Ima glide and swerve\. \
These hookers lookin so hard they straight hit the curb\. \
Gonna think of better things than some horny tricks\. \
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix\. \
I\'m gettin jacked\, Im breakin myself\. \
I cant believe theyre taking Warrens wealth\. \
They took my rings\, they took my rolex\. \
I looked at the brothas and said damn\, whats next\? \
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around\. \
Aint none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound\. \
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown\. \
I besta pull out my strap and lay them busters down\. \
They got guns to my head\. \
I think Im going down\. \
I cant believe this happened in my home town\. \
If I had wings I would fly\. \
Let me contemplate\. \
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate\. \
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole\. \
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold\. \
Now they droppin and yellin\. \
Its a tad bit late\. \
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate\. \
I laid all them busters down\. \
I let my gat explode\. \
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode\. \
If you want skirts step back and observe\. \
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb\. \
Now Nate got the freaks\. \
And thats a known fact\. \
Before I got jacked I was on the same track\. \
Back up back up cuz it\'s on\. \
N A T E and me\. \
The Warren to the G\. \
Just like I thought\. \
They were in the same spot\. \
In need of some desperate help\. \
The Nate Dogg and the G child\. \
Were in need of something else\. \
One of them dames was sexy as hell\. \
I said ooh I like your size\. \
She said my cars broke down and you seem real nice\. \
would you let me ride\? \
I got a car full of girls and it\'s going real swell\. \
The next stop is the east side motel\. \
I'm tweaking\. \
Onto a whole new level\. \
G Funk\. \
Stept towards\. \
I dare ya\. \
Funk\. \
On a whole new level\. \
The rythmn is the base and the base is the treble\. \
Chords\. \
Strings\. \
We brings\. \
Melody\. \
G Funk\. \
Where rythmn is life\. \
And life is rythmn\. \
If you know like I know\. \
You dont want to step to this\. \
It's the G Funk era\. \
Funked out with a gangster twist\. \
If you smoke like I smoke\. \
Then you high like everyday\. \
And if your ass is a buster\. \
2 1 3 will regulate\. "
